# DAGpy

DAGpy is a data science collaboration tool based on iPython notebooks. It is designed to work seamlessly with popular VC systems like git, or as a server application. DAGpy manages a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of blocks of code, whit each block being a sequence of iPython notebook cells, together with their outputs. It enables data science teams to easily collaborate, minimizing code duplication often found in iPy notebooks based projects. It can also automate the process of code execution upon data changes or on schedule, and provide a clean interface to the data visualization dashboard designers and developers.
